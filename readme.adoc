= TigerGraph ML Workbench Documentation 

The ml-workbench repository contains the source files for our documentation of TigerGraph Server features, commands and syntax. The source files are built in link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora] and displayed to the end user in the link:https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/intro/introduction[TigerGraph Server Introduction] page of the user-facing documentation site.

It is a large repository covering installation, loading and querying data, references for errors, API endpoints and encryption among other topics. Most pages are action-oriented guides to complete certain tasks rather than reference documents.

Anybody may contribute to this repository with the goal of expanding and clarifying TigerGraph Server documentation for end users.

Contribute to this repository by making a branch and submitting a pull request with your proposed changes to the documentation. Please review the link:https://github.com/tigergraph/doc-site/blob/main/style-guide.adoc[TigerGraph Docs Style Guide] before making changes.
