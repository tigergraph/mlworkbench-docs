= TensorBoards
:experimental:

TensorBoards are visualizations of the machine learning model training process.
They work by continually reading log files while a model is training.

As you train a model using a notebook, you can connect your model log files and data set to a TensorBoard to see its progress in graph form as it trains.

== Create a TensorBoard

. Click on the btn:[+ New TensorBoard] button in the upper right corner of the Tensorboards tab.
. Enter the name.
. Choose the location of your data either as an Object Store link or a PVC and mount path. For a TigerGraph Cloud solution, the log files will be in a PVC.

After a few moments for initialization, the new TensorBoard appears in the list. Click btn:[Connect] to open a new tab to view the TensorBoard.
