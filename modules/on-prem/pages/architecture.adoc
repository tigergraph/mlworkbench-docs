=== ML Workbench Jupyter Plugin
The ML Workbench Jupyter Plugin is a JupyterLab-based development environment with TigerGraph specific utilities and components, such as a server manager and link to GraphStudio.
In addition, all Python libraries such as PyTorch Geometric, DGL, and TGML come pre-installed, so you donâ€™t have to worry about setting up the right Python environment.

The plugin is included in the xref:on-prem:sandbox.adoc[sandbox option] for getting started with ML Workbench.

=== pyTigerGraph

pyTigerGraph is a Python package installed on the computer or server that does the machine learning training.
The `tgml` package provides utilities such as vertex set splitting for training, validation, and testing, as well as graph data loaders for both PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL).
As `tgml` is a Python package, it can be installed anywhere Python is used.
