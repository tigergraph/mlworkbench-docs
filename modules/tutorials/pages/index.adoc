= Resources
:experimental:

TigerGraph has a robust set of tutorials and training data sets available to learn ML Workbench.

This section describes how to access these resources for your exploration needs.

If you have previously set up ML Workbench via xref:getting-started:sandbox.adoc[the sandbox option], you can skip these steps since all tutorials and data are included in the sandbox.


== Tutorials

TigerGraph's tutorials demonstrate each of the key Python functionalities of ML Workbench in the pyTigerGraph[gds] library.
They include end-to-end working examples to showcase how to build and deploy a link prediction and node prediction application using cutting edge graph machine learning techniques such as GraphSage, Graph Attention Neural Network and Graph Convolutional Neural Network using the PyTorch Geometric and DGL ML frameworks.

To clone the tutorial repository, navigate to your notebook terminal and run this command:

[source.wrap,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/mlworkbench-docs.git
----

Once completing the clone, the tutorial folder is added to your IDE:

== Sample Data

Our tutorial notebooks refer to two real datasets and a synthetic dataset.
We leveraged the link:https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid/[Cora] dataset to build a node classification application and a link prediction application using GNNs.

We also have the link:https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/[IMDB] dataset for heterogeneous graphs.

Otherwise, you can follow our notebook link:https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/mlworkbench-docs/blob/main/tutorials/basics/0_data_ingestion.ipynb[here] to download and import the sample dataset to your DB instance by following the section “Cora Dataset “ and “IMDB Dataset”.
