= Connect workbench to a TigerGraph Server
:experimental:

Connecting your ML workbench to a TigerGraph server gives you access to the graph data stored in your TigerGraph database.
This allows you to develop Graph Neural Network (GNN) models with production scale graph data.

== Prerequisites

== Procedure

. From your terminal, run `jupyter lab`.
This takes you to the jupyter lab server in your browser.
On the left pane of the page, click on the TigerGraph logo to open the workbench tab.
. Click btn:[Add Server] and filled in the relevant server and host information.
* Server IP is the IP address of the TigerGraph server.
If you are connecting to a cluster, provide the IP address of the m1 machine of the cluster.
* Host OS is the OS of the host machine that is running the workbench, not the OS of the server.
* GDPS port is the port to serve the Graph Data Processing Service (GDPS).
. Click btn:[Submit].
This adds a server to the list of servers in your workbench tab.
. Click btn:[GDPS] on the server you just added.
If you haven't connected to the server with the workbench before, you will be prompted to install GDPS on the server.
Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information about the server to install the GDPS.
After the installation is complete, your workbench is now connected to the TigerGraph server, and you are ready to start using your graph data to develop GNN models.

== Next steps

With the tutorials loaded and the Cora dataset loaded into your TigerGraph database, you are ready to start working through the tutorials.

Open the notebook and make sure to change the connection details such as the database URL and credentials are updated to your database.
