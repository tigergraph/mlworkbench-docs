= pyTigerGraph GDS Module

The centerpiece of the ML Workbench is its Python client:
xref:pytigergraph:intro:index.adoc[pyTigerGraph].

This Python package contains all the essential utilities you need to bootstrap your Graph Machine Learning journey with these key functions:

* Data loading/export
* Graph partitioning for preparing your training, validation, and test data set for your supervised graph machine learning model
* Featurizer for generating unique graph features
* Subgraph sampling for your stochastic training process.

Please refer to the xref:pytigergraph:gds:index.adoc[GDS Functions] section of the pyTigerGraph documentation to learn more about the submodules, classes, and methods, and to see working examples and code snippets.
