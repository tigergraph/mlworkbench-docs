== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.4
Released May 16th, 2023.

Updates made at the pyTigerGraph layer are denoted with (pyTigerGraph), and ML Workbench functionality is denoted with (ML Workbench).

NOTE: If you are using the Graph Data Science dataloaders, you must upgrade both the ML Workbench and pyTigerGraph to 1.4 at the same time.
There is a incompatibility between v1.3 and v1.4 of pyTigerGraph and the corresponding ML Workbench versions. 

=== New features
* Built in Graph ML models and Trainer (pyTigerGraph)
- xref:pytigergraph:gds:graphsage.adoc[Various GraphSAGE models] for vertex classification and regression, as well as link prediction.
- xref:pytigergraph:gds:nodepiece.adoc[NodePiece MLP model] for vertex classification.
- xref:pytigergraph:gds:trainer.adoc[General purpose trainer] to enable training of Graph ML models in a concise fashion.

* Transforms (pyTigerGraph)
- xref:pytigergraph:gds:pyg_transforms.adoc[`PyGTemporalTransform`] to create a sequence of subgraphs for a given batch of data, in a temporal manner.
- xref:pytigergraph:gds:nodepiece_transforms.adoc[`NodePieceMLPTransform`] to transform a batch produced by a NodePiece dataloader into a batch that can be fed into a PyTorch multilayer perceptron.

* SSL Support in Kafka Dataloaders (ML Workbench & pyTigerGraph)
    - Two-way SSL encryption via Kerberos.

* Collaborative dataloaders (ML Workbench & pyTigerGraph)
    - Use dataloaders on multiple machines to pull batches from the same Kafka queue. Helpful for data distributed model training.

* Additional Dataloader Support
(See xref:1.4@pytigergraph:release-notes:index.adoc[pyTigerGraph Release Notes])

- `DATETIME` support in dataloaders.
- Optional `distributed_query` parameter in dataloaders if running on distributed database clusters.
- `stop()` function in dataloaders.


=== Updated features
* Dataloader factory produces multiple dataloaders if `filter_by` is a list of different filters. (pyTigerGraph)
* Improved the scalability of the NodePiece dataloader. (pyTigerGraph)

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.3
Released April 2023

=== New features

* Two new xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:dataloaders.adoc[data loader classes]: `HGTLoader` and `NodePiece`.
* Callback functions to all xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:gds.adoc[data loader factories]: users can write functions to process the batch in a background thread before it is passed into the training loop.
* A delimiter parameter to all xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:gds.adoc[data loader factories]: users can choose what delimiter they want to separate attributes they are loading from the graph.

=== Updated features

* Template query support in the xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:featurizer.adoc[featurizer] (requires TigerGraph Database version 3.9+).
* Data splitters to automatically perform a schema change if needed to add attributes to the database.
* Support for multi-edges in the `upsertEdges()` function.
* Better error messaging.

=== Fixes

* Fixed SSL certificate handling when custom certificate is used.
* Removed ANSI escape characters from output of `.gsql()` calls.
* Improved the logic for shuffling vertices in dataloaders when `filter_by` attribute was used.
* Improved the batching algorithm in dataloaders so that the output batches have a consistent batch size.
* Changed `getVertexCount()` endpoint to more scalable solution.

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.1 (September 2022)

=== New features

* TensorFlow support for homogeneous GNNs via the Spektral library
* Heterogeneous Graph Dataloading support for DGL
* Support for lists of strings in dataloaders
* Activator for both Community and Enterprise editions of the ML Workbench (see link:https://act.tigergraphlabs.com[] for details)

=== Updated features

* Fixed KeyError when creating a data loader on a graph where `PrimaryIdAsAttribute` is `False`
* Error catch if Kafka dataloader doesn't run in asynchronous mode
* Schema now refreshes during dataloader instantiation and featurizer attribute addition
* Connection instantiation time reduced
* Reinstall query if it is disabled
* Confirm Kafka topic is created before subscription
* Streamlined Kafka resource usage
* Allow multiple consumers on the same data
* Improved deprecation warnings

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.0 (August 2022)

=== New features

Soft launch of TigerGraph ML Workbench on Cloud, an end-to-end Kubeflow-managed cloud platform for training and serving machine learning models.

* Complete KubeFlow integration
* Fully-managed infrastructure orchestrated by Kubernetes
* Connection to TigerGraph Cloud Solutions
* Cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebooks
* TensorBoard integration
* Experiments with AutoML (beta)

=== Known Issues

* When creating a new Notebook, the user is prompted for Configurations and Affinity/Tolerations.
These have no effect on the notebook.
