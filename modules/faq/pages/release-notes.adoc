= Release Notes

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.3

=== New features

* Two new xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:dataloaders.adoc[data loader classes]: `HGTLoader` and `NodePiece`.
* Callback functions to all xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:gds.adoc[data loader factories]: users can write functions to process the batch in a background thread before it is passed into the training loop.
* A delimiter parameter to all xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds.adoc[data loader factories]: users can choose what delimiter they want to separate attributes they are loading from the graph.

=== Updated features

* Template query support in the xref:1.3@pytigergraph:gds:featurizer.adoc[featurizer] (requires TigerGraph Database version 3.9+).
* Data splitters to automatically perform a schema change if needed to add attributes to the database.
* Support for multi-edges in the `upsertEdges()` function.
* Better error messaging.

=== Fixes

* Fixed SSL certificate handling when custom certificate is used.
* Removed ANSI escape characters from output of `.gsql()` calls.
* Improved the logic for shuffling vertices in dataloaders when `filter_by` attribute was used.
* Improved the batching algorithm in dataloaders so that the output batches have a consistent batch size.
* Changed `getVertexCount()` endpoint to more scalable solution.

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.1 (September 2022)

=== New features

* TensorFlow support for homogeneous GNNs via the Spektral library
* Heterogeneous Graph Dataloading support for DGL
* Support for lists of strings in dataloaders
* Activator for both Developer and Enterprise editions of the ML Workbench (see link:https://act.tigergraphlabs.com[] for details)

=== Updated features

* Fixed KeyError when creating a data loader on a graph where `PrimaryIdAsAttribute` is `False`
* Error catch if Kafka dataloader doesn't run in asynchronous mode
* Schema now refreshes during dataloader instantiation and featurizer attribute addition
* Connection instantiation time reduced
* Reinstall query if it is disabled
* Confirm Kafka topic is created before subscription
* Streamlined Kafka resource usage
* Allow multiple consumers on the same data
* Improved deprecation warnings

== TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.0 (August 2022)
