= Resource Quotas

In order to protect the environment from resource overdraft, each end user is assigned a resource quota. The resource quotas are based on total system capacity and apply to the following resources:

* Pods (VMs)
* Virtual CPUs
* RAM
* GPU
* Disk Space

Contact TigerGraph Support to learn more about the specific quotas that may apply to your account.
