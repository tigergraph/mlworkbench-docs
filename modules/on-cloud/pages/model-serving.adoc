= Model Serving
:experimental:

Model serving is a way to make a pre-trained machine learning model available as a service.

ML Workbench uses the link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/kserve/webapp/[KServe Models UI] to display the KubeFlow InferenceServices.
An InferenceService is a Kubernetes CustomResource (CR) that enables running inference requests on a trained model.

== Introduction

Click the Models tab on the left sidebar to access the list of model servers.

Each model server is created by defining a list of attributes that describe how to access the model in YAML format.
ML Workbench creates a standard API for each model so that new data can be sent to the model for predictions.

Server scaling happens by default without any user input to dynamically spend resources on certain models.

The attributes shown for each model server are as follows:

|===
|Attribute | Explanation

|Status | Whether the model server is ready for API requests
|Name  | User-generated name for the model server
|Age | Time since the model server was created
|Predictor | Name of the dataset used for the model
|Runtime | Runtime version
|Protocol | Version of the model that is being served
|Storage URI | Location of the trained model, usually on cloud storage or Kubernetes PVC
|===

== Create a New Model

=== Prerequisites

* A trained model accessible on cloud storage or a Kubernetes PVC

=== Procedure

. Click btn:[+ New Model Server] at the top of the model list.
. In YAML format, enter the attributes and location of the model.
. Wait for ML Workbench to provision the necessary infrastructure.m

== Model server details

Once a model server is running, click on it to expand the view and reveal additional information.
