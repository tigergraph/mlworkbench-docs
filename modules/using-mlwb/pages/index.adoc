= Introduction

ML Workbench on Cloud is designed to require minimal setup.

== First Launch

Access ML Workbench from the TigerGraph Cloud main page.

[NOTE]
Your TigerGraph Cloud account must have access to a TigerGraph Cloud solution in order to connect that solution to an ML Workbench notebook.

The first time anyone in a new TigerGraph Cloud organization accesses ML Workbench, they will see a prompt for a namespace.
This namespace is analogous to a project name managing the connection of one or several TigerGraph Cloud solutions with one or several ML Workbench tools.
