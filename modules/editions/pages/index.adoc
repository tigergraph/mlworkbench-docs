= Editions

TigerGraph ML Workbench is available as a service through TigerGraph Cloud or standalone in two editions, Community and Enterprise.

While both on-prem editions offer useful Python-level features for your data science needs, the Enterprise edition offers more powerful features to support production-level model training on enterprise-level data sets.

The tables below can help you compare the key differences between the editions.

== ML Workbench on TigerGraph Cloud

The Enterprise Edition ML Workbench is available on xref:on-cloud:on-tgcloud.adoc[TigerGraph Cloud], bundled together with a database instance.
This is the quickest and easiest way to get started with graph machine learning.

//The second is currently invitation-only. Built on KubeFlow, it offers several unique AutoML and visualization features conveniently in a single web framework.

//TigerGraphâ€™s Machine Learning Workbench is a fully-managed platform that accelerates development and deployment of graph-enhanced machine learning, which leverages the added insights from connected data and graph features for better predictions. ML Workbench delivers a scalable Graph ML model orchestrated by Kubeflow running on Kubernetes containers.

//Due to its accurate predictive power stemming from unique graph features and graph models, the workbench enables organizations to unlock even better insights and greater business impact at scale.

//Please see the link:https://www.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/[official product page] for early access information.
